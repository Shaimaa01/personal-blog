### What I learned

In this project, I learned:

- **useContext** for managing global state without prop drilling.
- **React Markdown** and its **"black magic"** âœ¨ with plugins like `rehype-highlight`, `rehype-raw`, and `remark-gfm` to render and enhance Markdown content in React.

### Continued Development

I am currently learning **Sass** to improve my CSS workflow and enhance styling efficiency in future projects.

### Useful Resources

- [useContext Explained Simply](https://youtu.be/FpNfvbNYPsg?si=K2gZtGV__OOHM1t5) - This video helped me understand and simplify the concept of `useContext` in React. Highly recommended for anyone learning state management!
